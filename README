parseargs -- command-line argument parsing for Haskell programs
version 0.1.3

This library provides System.Console.Parseargs, a module to
assist in argument parsing for Haskell stand-alone command
line programs.

To use this library, your program needs a structured
description of the arguments it expects.  It supplies this
description to an argument parser, which creates a data
structure from which parsed arguments can be extracted as
needed.  See the Haddock documentation for the gory details.

I have used this code with ghc 6.{6, 8, 10, 12} and various
development versions on Linux.  It is a fairly standard
Hackage-ready package, to the extent I know how to construct
such.

The 0.1.2 release includes a typeclass for argument types for
easier use.

The 0.1.3 release includes more uniform and usable error
handling.

This is not what I set out to build.  It definitely could
also use some work.  I use it all the time for writing
little programs, though.I thought others might find it
useful; I also have released other code that depends on it.

Have fun with it, and let me know if there are problems.
