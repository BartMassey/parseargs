parseargs -- command-line argument parsing for Haskell programs
version 0.1.2

This library provides System.Console.Parseargs, a module to
assist in argument parsing for Haskell stand-alone command
line programs.

To use this library, your program needs a structured
description of the arguments it expects.  It supplies this
description to an argument parser, which creates a data
structure from which parsed arguments can be extracted as
needed.  See the Haddock documentation for the gory details.

I have used this code with ghc 6.6, ghc 6.8, and current GHC
on Linux, although the current cabal setup has only been
tested with cabal 1.2 and ghc 6.8.  It is a fairly standard
Hackage-ready package, to the extent I know how to construct
such.

The 1.2 release includes a typeclass for argument types for
easier use.

This is not what I set out to build.  It definitely could
also use some work.  I use it all the time for writing
little programs, though.I thought others might find it
useful; I also have released other code that depends on it.

Have fun with it, and let me know if there are problems.
